# Research Interests

I explore **computational and statistical methods in medical imaging**, combining my background in mechatronics, robotics and data-driven modeling. Current focus areas:

- **Medical Image Analysis** – segmentation, registration, and tomographic data processing  
- **Statistical Shape and Motion Modeling** – probabilistic PCA and latent-space analysis for anatomical variability  
- **Deformable Image Registration** – evaluation of error and uncertainty in 3D images  
- **Machine Learning Applications** – modeling physiological systems from imaging data

# Projects & Publications

<!--
### Probabilistic PCA for Missing Data
- Implementation in **NumPy/Pyro**, exploring latent-space uncertainty

### Pulmonary Registration Error Analysis
- Tools for **3D DVF evaluation, error maps, and histogram-based segmentation**  
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vestopier/pulmonary-registration)
